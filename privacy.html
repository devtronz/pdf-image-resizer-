# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 1, 2026

Thank you for using **PDF & Image Resizer** — an open-source tool to resize and compress PDFs and images.

We are committed to your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect (if any), how we handle it, and your rights.

## 1. What We Do NOT Do
- We **do not** upload, store, or permanently keep your files on any server.  
  All core processing (resizing, compression, conversion) happens **directly in your browser** using client-side JavaScript libraries (jsPDF, pdf.js, etc.).
- We **do not** use tracking cookies, analytics tools (Google Analytics, etc.), advertising, or any third-party services that monitor your behavior.
- We **do not** collect personal data such as names, emails, IP addresses for profiling, or any identifiable information unless explicitly provided (e.g., if you open a GitHub issue).
- We **do not** sell, share, or disclose any user data to third parties.

## 2. What We MAY Collect (Minimal & Optional)
We may use **first-party cookies** (or browser localStorage) **only** to improve your experience by remembering preferences you set, such as:
- Selected image quality level
- Preferred dimensions or resize options
- UI settings (e.g., dark/light theme if implemented)

These are **strictly functional / preference cookies**:
- Stored only on your device
- Never sent to us or any third party
- You can delete them anytime via browser settings (clear cookies/site data)

No cookies are set without your continued use of the tool after seeing this policy (implied consent for non-tracking purposes).

## 3. Server-Side Processing (If Applicable)
If you use a hosted version of this tool (not running locally):
- Some operations might be routed through a minimal Node.js server (`server.js`) for performance on large files.
- Even then: Files are processed temporarily in memory and **not stored** after the response is sent.
- No logs tie requests to individuals; standard server logs (IP, timestamp, request path) may exist temporarily for debugging/hosting purposes only and are not used for tracking.

## 4. Your Rights
Depending on your location (e.g., GDPR in EU/EEA, CCPA/CPRA in California, etc.), you may have rights such as:
- Accessing any minimal data we hold (usually none)
- Requesting deletion of any stored preferences (clear browser cookies)
- Objecting to or restricting processing (stop using the tool or clear data)

Since we collect almost nothing, most requests will simply confirm that no personal data exists.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy occasionally (e.g., when adding new features like more preference saving). Changes will be posted here with an updated effective date. Continued use after changes means acceptance.


we only log analytics cookies for operational purposes but we are not processing your data it's locally processed.
